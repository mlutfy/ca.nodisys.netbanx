View the README.txt for general information about this module before installing.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

* The "curl" PHP library. Under Debian, apt-get install php5-curl.
  This library is necessary for when communicating credit card information
  with the payment gateway.

INSTALLATION:
------------

* Enable this extension in CiviCRM (Admin > System Settings > Extensions).

* In CiviCRM > Admin > CiviMail > Message templates (/civicrm/admin/messageTemplates?reset=1),
  go to the "System messages" subtab. Edit the "Contributions - Receipt (on-line)" template
  and add the token "Desjardins CC receipt", i.e. {contribution.desjardins_receipt} in the 
  "credit card information" section of the template (both HTML and text formats).

* In the receipt template, add a section with the "Terms and conditions", including
  your privacy policy, shipping fees (even if there are none) and refund policy.

* In CiviCRM > Admin > Configure > Domain information (civicrm/admin/domain?action=update&reset=1),
  make sure you have set correct values for the organisation name, e-mail and postal address.

* Create a custom field for contribution with a checkbox field "Terms and conditions" (ToS). 
  Include it in a footer profile for the contribution page, and make it mandatory. The help 
  text for the field should link (and open in a new window) to your site's terms and conditions
  (site privacy policy, terms of use, refund/cancellation policy, shipping policy).

  ToS must be visible on the contribution/event page, confirmation page and thank you page,
  as well as on the receipt. You may need to modify the message templates to integrate them.

* Either set your currency to "$ CAD" (but that is rather ugly), or add the following text
  at the end of the financial information of the Contribution/{Main,Confirm,ThankYou}.tpl:
  English: "All amounts are in canadian dollars ($ CAD)".
  French: "Tous les montants sont en dollars canadiens ($ CAD)".

Drupal variables:

* Set the civicrmdesjardins_tos_url and civicrmdesjardins_tos_text variables, with respectively
  the URL to your ToS and the description of your refund policy. This is not mandatory, but
  otherwise you will have to add it manually to your receipt footer.
  There is no UI for this yet, use drush vset.

* Desjardins requires that the name on the receipts be the formal organisation name (matching
  the name on their records). By default the domain name will be displayed (from the "domain
  information"). You can override it by setting the civicrmdesjardins_orgname Drupal variable.

* If you have a multi-lingual site, enable the 'variable' Drupal module, set the variables
  as multi-lingual (admin/config/regional/i18n/variable) then go to config > system > variables
  (admin/config/system/variable) to translate the variables.

TESTING
-------

Along with regular and recurrent transactions (if supported), you should also test failed
transations. You can trigger various types of errors by using specific amounts under 1$:
